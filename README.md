# MaterializeModal
Small library to work more efficiently with modals from the MaterializeCSS framework.

I've been working on a single-page web-app for our company in which I heavily used modals for all the functionality. I quickly realized that adding all those modals to the HTML file was kind of a mess and doing anything dynamic was a pain in the ass (forms, collections, ..).
And that's why I've developed this small library.
